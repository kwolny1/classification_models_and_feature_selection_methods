# Classification Models and Feature Selection methods

The goal of this project was to compare different classification models and feature selection methods to find the best-performing combination on the given dataset. The performance of your model was scored as follows:

- For each correctly identified household (i.e., one that did indeed exceed the threshold), the utility company pays you EUR 10.
- For each variable used in your model, you must pay EUR 200 to simulate the cost of acquiring and processing that data.

We started with checking what is the best model we could create while using all of the availiable features. Then, we performed experiments with different models, number of features, and methods of selecting those features.
